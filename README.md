# Geospatial Data Visualizer

## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing geospatial data using PostgreSQL, MySQL, and KML (Keyhole Markup Language). It includes functionalities for sampling data points into databases, generating KML files for visualization on Google Maps, and performing geospatial queries such as convex hull generation and nearest neighbor searches.

## Features
- **Database Integration**: Sampled data points into both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases for flexibility and compatibility.
- **KML Generation**: Generated KML files to visualize data points on Google Maps for geographical representation.
- **Geospatial Queries**: Executed SQL queries to compute a convex hull for data points and find nearest neighbors to specific data points.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and perform efficient geospatial computations.
- **Modular Design**: Built with modular components for easy expansion and integration of additional features.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: Used for storing and querying geospatial data.
- **MySQL**: Employed alongside PostgreSQL for comparative analysis and flexibility.
- **KML (Keyhole Markup Language)**: Used for generating geospatial data visualizations on Google Maps.
- **SQL**: Executed SQL queries for geospatial computations.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for scripting and backend operations.
